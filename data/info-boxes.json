            "Hi! I'm Max, a <strong>full stack developer</strong> transitioning from a career in architecture and computational design within the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) industry. With a strong background in programming languages like <strong>JavaScript/TypeScript</strong>, <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>C#</strong>, I've specialised in computational designâ€”using algorithmic and rules-based approaches to solve complex building engineering problems. This includes designing automated workflows for multiple projects and creating parametric models to handle intricate geometries.",
            "I'm eager to combine my experience in computational design and data science with software engineering, and I'm interested in exploring areas like <strong>DevOps</strong>, <strong>machine learning</strong>, and <strong>AI</strong>. I'm excited to create innovative web applications that make a positive impact and look forward to contributing to forward-thinking teams that value collaboration, continuous learning, and making a difference through technology."

I'm diving deep into technologies like <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, and <strong>Node.js</strong>, and collaborating on team projects that follow Agile methodologies and test-driven development. This experience is the most significant part of my current journey, allowing me to fully embrace a career in tech and pursue my passion for developing tools that help people.",
            "Independently, I've been working on several projects to enhance my skills and contribute to the developer community. One of my projects, <strong><a href='https://maxitect.github.io/accessible-colour-palette/'>Colarity</a></strong>, is a colour palette generator that ensures WCAG compliance, helping developers create accessible designs quickly. This project is allowing me to delve into full-stack development using technologies like <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, and <strong>Material UI</strong>. Although this is still work in progress with a purely functional UI at the moment."

I'm an avid cyclist and enjoy exploring the outdoors through hiking and rock climbing. Sports like golf and tennis keep me active. In my leisure time, I enjoy games with friends, reading, comics, novels and listening to music. I am often attending theatre productions, art shows and exhibitions. I love to travel, having been to 37 countries across all continents but Australia. Experiencing diverse cultures and exploring wildlife around the world has shaped me and continues to provide me with fresh perspectives."
