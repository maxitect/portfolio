            "Hi! I'm Max, a <strong>full stack developer</strong> transitioning from a career in architecture and computational design within the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) industry. With a strong background in programming languages like <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>C#</strong>, I've specialised in computational designâ€”using algorithmic and rules-based approaches to solve complex building engineering problems. This includes designing automated workflows for multiple projects and creating parametric models to handle intricate geometries.",
            "I'm eager to combine my experience in computational design and data science with software engineering, and I'm interested in exploring areas like <strong>DevOps</strong>, <strong>machine learning</strong>, and <strong>AI</strong>. I'm excited to create innovative web applications that make a positive impact and look forward to contributing to forward-thinking teams that value collaboration, continuous learning, and making a difference through technology."

One of my projects, <strong><a href='https://maxitect.github.io/accessible-colour-palette/'>Colarity</a></strong>, is a colour palette generator that ensures WCAG compliance, helping developers create accessible designs quickly. This project allowed me to delve into full-stack development using technologies like <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, and <strong>Material UI</strong>. Although not all of these technologies are yet implemented as it is still in progress."
